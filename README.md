# Etch-a-Sketch
The objective of this project is to build a browser version of an amalgam of a sketchpad and etch-a-sketch, and to flex DOM Manipulation skills.

## Final Outcome

## Thoughts
Lighten function does not work the way I intended to, still lacks darken function and start button animation.
